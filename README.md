# LibreTranslate Obsidian Plugin

LibreTranslate is an Obsidian plugin that translates selected text or entire notes using a LibreTranslate-compatible server. It is designed to work well with markdown content and offers both inline replacement and callout-based translation output.

## Features
- Translate a selected text fragment in place
- Translate an entire markdown document
- Preserve markdown structure during translation where possible
- Protect callouts, links, code spans, and other markdown-sensitive content
- Insert translations as a callout or replace the original text
- Choose source and target languages
- Refresh available languages from the configured server
- Reset language-only or full plugin settings

## Example usage

### Translate selected text
1. Select a paragraph in your note.
2. Run the command or use the context menu action.
3. The selected text is translated and inserted according to your output setting.

### Translate an entire document
1. Open a markdown note.
2. Run "Translate entire document".
3. The full note is translated and written back to the editor.

### Callout output example

Original:

```md
Hello world
```

Result with callout output enabled:

```md
Hello world

> [!note] Translation
> Bonjour le monde
```

## Install from the Obsidian Community Plugin store

1. Open Obsidian.
2. Go to Settings -> Community plugins.
3. Make sure Safe Mode is off.
4. Click Browse.
5. Search for "LibreTranslate".
6. Click Install, then Enable.
7. Open the plugin settings and configure your LibreTranslate server URL and language preferences.

## Configure the server

The plugin works with any LibreTranslate-compatible endpoint. By default it uses:

```text
https://translate.libregalaxy.org
```

You can change this in the plugin settings if you run your own instance.

## Known issues

- Markdown preservation is best-effort and may not be perfect for every structure.
- Some complex callout or blockquote layouts may still need manual cleanup.
- Translation output can vary depending on the selected LibreTranslate server and the source text.

## Caveat

I'm not a developer, therefor this plugin and its current implementation are largely vibe coded: the feature set is functional, but the codebase may still contain rough edges, assumptions, and areas that need cleanup or hardening.
